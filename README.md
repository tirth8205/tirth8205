**AI/ML Engineer**

I'm a software engineer who builds machine learning systems. I like working on different types of AI projects - from chatbots and image recognition to predicting data trends. Sometimes I also work on brain-computer interface stuff, which is pretty cool.

I enjoy the problem-solving side of ML engineering and figuring out how to make models work well in real applications.

## What I Build

**Text and Language Stuff** — Working with large language models, chatbots, and text processing  
**Computer Vision** — Image classification, object detection, and visual AI systems  
**Data Prediction** — Building models to forecast trends and spot patterns in data  
**Neural Interfaces** — Experimenting with brain signals and cognitive computing (research side)  
**Web Applications** — Full-stack development with ML backends and APIs

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++, SQL  
**ML Libraries:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, OpenCV  
**Web/API:** FastAPI, Flask, React, Node.js  
**Data:** Pandas, NumPy, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
**Cloud/Tools:** Docker, Git, AWS, Google Cloud

## What I'm Learning

- Fine-tuning models for specific use cases
- Building better data pipelines and MLOps workflows  
- Computer vision applications in real-world scenarios
- Time series forecasting and anomaly detection
- Making ML models production-ready and scalable
