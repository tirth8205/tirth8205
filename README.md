# Tirth Kanani - AI & ML Engineer

## About Me
Hi! I am a UK-based Software & Machine Learning Engineer with Indian roots and a strong computer science background. I have a Master's in CS with a specialisation in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of Birmingham.

I believe in applying AI and machine learning not only to tackle difficult challenges, but also to create deliberate, user-centric solutions that have a meaningful effect. From writing tidy, scalable code to working on open-source initiatives, I enjoy combining technical substance with human-centered design.

I am currently looking for new opportunities where I can leverage my AI, ML, and software engineering skills to create innovative, impactful tech. Let's stay in touch if you're building something cool- or just want to geek out about awesome ideas!

## Expertise
- Language models and semantic search systems for actionable insights
- Brain-computer interfaces for neural signal decoding
- Knowledge graph development for efficient data connections
- Explainable AI implementations ensuring transparency
- Applied AI in neuroscience and academic research domains
